The game is simple. Within the Console it'll print out a grid, with each point on the grip censored. You must input the coordinate you would like to check for a mine.
As such: A:1

YOU MUST INPUT IT IN THIS WAY, ANY OTHER WAY IS INVALID!

To win the game you must check half of the entire grid for a bomb.
If you find a bomb, you lose.

To quit the game at anything, input: quit or QUIT.

Enjoy the game!
